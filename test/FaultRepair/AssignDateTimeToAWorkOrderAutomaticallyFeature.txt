Feature 3
Assign a date and time automatically

Given a list of work orders with state assigned

When the work order scheduler selects to schedule automatically
and selects to allow displacement of lower priority work orders
Then the scheduler calculates a time slot 
and the work order is allocated to that time slot
and the scheduler calculates new time slots for a displaced lower priority work order
